# Cadra Trace Tracker — Claude Code Plugin

Submit your Claude Code work sessions to Cadra for a coding assessment.

The plugin is **skills only**: there are no hooks and no background processes.
Nothing is read, converted, or sent unless you ask for it in a conversation. All
state lives in your workspace's `.cadra/` folder, which the plugin gitignores
before it writes anything into it.

## The three skills

| Say | Skill | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| "connect to Cadra" | `cadra-connect` | Registers this workspace against your assessment token and proves the token works right away. Writes `.cadra/config.json`. |
| "submit my trace" | `cadra-submit` | Previews exactly what would be sent, waits for your go-ahead, then submits and reports the server's receipt. |
| "show my traces" | `cadra-traces` | Read-only list of what the server actually holds. Never uploads. |

You can submit as many times as you like. Each session is sent again only if it
has changed since the last accepted submission.

## Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/NishantCadra/Cadra-Claude-Code-Plugin
claude plugin install cadra-trace-tracker@cadra
```

Then, in the root of your solution repository, run `claude` and say
"connect to Cadra". You will be asked for the assessment token and proxy URL
shown on your Cadra Setup page. Requires Python 3.11+ on `PATH`; the plugin uses
the standard library only, so there is nothing to `pip install`.

## Filesystem contract

```
<workspace>/
  .gitignore          ← cadra-connect appends ".cadra/" if it is not already there
  .cadra/
    config.json       ← token and assessment binding (chmod 0600 on macOS/Linux)
    state.json        ← which sessions have been accepted, and at what content
    last-preview.json ← exactly what the last submit sent, or would have sent
```

**The write boundary is the load-bearing guarantee:** the plugin writes *only*
inside `<workspace>/.cadra/`, plus that single append to `<workspace>/.gitignore`
at connect time. Every other filesystem access is read-only. This is enforced by
`tests/test_write_boundary.py`, which snapshots the whole workspace byte for byte
around a real submission, a dry run, and a connect.

There is one stated read exception: Claude Code stores transcripts under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/`, and no copy of them exists inside the repo,
so the plugin reads them there. It never writes there, and your transcripts are
left untouched — also a test.

## Privacy model

- **You trigger everything.** No hooks, no session-end uploads, no background
  daemon. If you never say "submit my trace", nothing ever leaves the machine.
- **Preview before send.** `cadra-submit` runs a dry run first: it builds the
  exact payload, writes it to `.cadra/last-preview.json`, prints every working
  directory the sessions visited, and sends nothing. You decide from there.
- **Scope.** Only sessions started in this workspace or below it are collected.
  Sessions started elsewhere are never read.
- **Redaction.** Secrets matching the shared rule set are replaced before the
  payload is hashed or sent, and the affected files are reported to the server so
  they are excluded from scoring rather than counted against you.
- **No database credentials.** The plugin holds one assessment token, issued to
  you, and talks only to the Cadra proxy. Identity is derived server-side from
  the token; the client never asserts who you are.
- **The server is the authority.** A submission is reported as saved only when
  the server has confirmed it.
