"""cadra-submit — collect, transform, redact and send this workspace's sessions.

Pipeline order is load-bearing (§7, §8, §9): transform, then redact, then apply
size controls, and only then hash and chunk. Hashing before redaction would make
the fingerprint describe text that is never sent, so a rules change would look
like "nothing new". Both sets of touched paths — the ones redaction rewrote and
the ones the size caps truncated — are merged into one `truncated_paths` list, so
the server drops those files from the attestation denominator instead of scoring
them as unattested (§8.1).

The server is the authority on success: nothing is written to `state.json` for a
session until every one of its chunks has been accepted.

`--dry-run` runs the whole pipeline and writes the preview but sends nothing.
That is what makes the preview *pre*-send (§6.1): a session may leave the
workspace after starting in it, and the candidate has to be able to see where it
went and decline before anything leaves the machine.
