# Skill: cadra-submit
**Plugin:** cadra-trace-tracker

## Purpose

Collect the sessions run in this workspace, convert and redact them, and submit
them to Cadra with a server-confirmed receipt.

## Preconditions

The workspace must be connected (`.cadra/config.json` present). If it is not, run
the cadra-connect skill instead.

## Plugin root

`<PLUGIN_ROOT>` is the absolute path two directories above this SKILL.md (the
plugin folder). Hosts that set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` or `PLUGIN_ROOT` fill it in
for you; otherwise substitute it. If this SKILL.md was reached through a
symlink (OpenCode installs), resolve it first with `realpath`.

The commands below say `python3`. Use `python3` if it exists, else `python`, else
`py -3` (typical on Windows). The script paths and arguments stay the same.

## Steps

1. **Preview first — nothing is sent by this step:**

   ```
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${PLUGIN_ROOT:-<PLUGIN_ROOT>}}/scripts/cadra_submit.py" --workspace "<WORKSPACE>" --dry-run
   ```

2. Show the user what would be sent, and **ask them to confirm before step 3**:
   - the `FOUND` count and, per session, the `DRY-RUN` line (messages, chunks,
     redactions);
   - every `CWD` line. This matters: a session that started in the workspace may
     have moved elsewhere while running, and those directories are listed here.
     If any of them look private or unrelated, say so plainly — the user can
     decline and nothing will have left the machine.

   Do not run step 3 until the user agrees. If they decline, stop; there is
   nothing to undo.

3. Run the real submission and capture ALL output:

   ```
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${PLUGIN_ROOT:-<PLUGIN_ROOT>}}/scripts/cadra_submit.py" --workspace "<WORKSPACE>"
   ```

4. Report the result in plain language:
   - `FOUND n session(s)` → how many sessions were found for this workspace. Say
     the number even when it is zero.
   - `SUBMITTED` lines → how many sessions were sent, and the server's confirmed
     message count. This is the server's receipt, not a local claim.
   - `SKIP` lines → already submitted and unchanged.
   - `NEW-CWD` lines → a directory the session entered *after* the preview the
     user approved. Say so plainly and name the directory: the transcript keeps
     growing while you talk, so the preview cannot be the last word on where a
     session went. If it looks private, tell them it has already been sent and
     that they should raise it with the program team.
   - `NOTE` lines → transcripts that were examined and left out, with the reason
     the script gave: started in a sibling directory, or carrying no recorded
     working directory. Report only those reasons. Mention that
     starting your agent from the workspace root keeps future sessions in scope.
   - `FAILED` lines → say which session failed and why in one sentence, followed
     by any `HINT` line the script printed. Common cases: no internet (retry
     later, nothing is lost); an unaccepted token (re-run cadra-connect with a
     fresh one); `rejected_revoked` or `rejected_expired` (contact the program
     team); `binding_mismatch` (this workspace's folder name differs from the one
     registered — the candidate has most likely connected a different project).
   - "Everything is already submitted" → say exactly that.

5. If the user asks what was sent, point them at `.cadra/last-preview.json`, which
   records each session's messages exactly as submitted, the directories it
   visited, and how many secrets were redacted. The dry run writes the same file,
   so it can be inspected before deciding.

## Rules

- Always run the script. Never claim work is submitted without a server receipt.
- Never skip the dry run, and never send without the user's agreement. The
  preview is the only point at which a session that wandered outside the
  workspace can be caught, and it is worthless after the fact.
- Never print the token.
- In a sandbox (e.g. Codex), if the submit says the server was not reached, ask the
  user to approve network access for this command and rerun it; nothing is lost.
  Never change sandbox settings yourself.
- Only sessions started in this workspace or below it are collected. A session
  started in a directory *above* the workspace is out of scope and is not
  detected at all — see design §6.1. Do not tell the user such sessions were
  found or reported.
- The current session's final turns are not included — the transcript is written
  as the session progresses. Mention this only if the user asks.
